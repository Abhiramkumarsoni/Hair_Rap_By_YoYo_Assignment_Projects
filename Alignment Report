## ⚠️ Items Needing Attention

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### 1. Demo Video (❌ Missing)
>
> The assignment explicitly requires a **5–7 minute demo video**. This is not present in the project.
> You will need to record a walkthrough covering: data generation, model training, dashboard demo, API demo, and explanation of the architecture.

> [!WARNING]
>
> ### 2. GitHub Repository (⚠️ Unverified)
>
> The assignment says "GitHub Repository" as a deliverable. Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository and the link is ready to share.

## 💯 Overall Assessment

Your implementation is **very well aligned** with the assignment requirements. All core technical requirements — prediction engine, dashboard, retention intelligence, and production thinking — are fully implemented. The only gaps are the **demo video** (which must be recorded separately) and verifying the **GitHub repo** is ready.

### Bonus Points (Beyond Requirements)

- ✨ MLflow integration for experiment tracking (not required but impressive)
- ✨ FastAPI REST API with Swagger docs (demonstrates production readiness)
- ✨ Batch prediction endpoint
- ✨ Model Registry with versioning
- ✨ 19 engineered features (far beyond the minimum dataset columns)
- ✨ Premium dashboard styling with custom CSS
